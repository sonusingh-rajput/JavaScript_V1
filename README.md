## History of JavaScript

### This is Netscape Navigator
 - A web browser which used to dominate the world in 90s with the market share of around 90%.
 - This is where the story of JavaScript starts from.

### Static Websites 
 - Website used to be static then. and browsers could not do even a single calculation at that time.
- In order to do even a simple math browser had to talk to servers.

### Making the Language of Web
- So the Founder of Netscape decided to develope a programming language for his Netscape.

### Making the Language of Web
- In september 1995 Andreessen hires one guy called Brendan Eich to develop that Language.
#### <b>Development of JavaScript </b>
-  Brendan stats the Development and the rest is History. He Developed the whole new Language in just 10 freaking days and that language was called "Mocha". Then it is was changed to "LiveScript" and then finally JavaScript.


## Data Types in JavaScript

## JavaScript Variables

A javascript variable is just a name of storage location,and we can give that name in three ways.

- Using var Keyword
- Using const Keyword

#### Rule of naming Variables

A variable name can contains any of the following characters but must not start with a digits.

- <b>Capital Letters:</b> A to Z
- <b>Small Letters:</b> a to z
- <b>Digits:</b> 0 to 9 (but we can't start variable name with a digit)
- <b>Only two special characters that are:</b> Dollar "$" and Underscore "_

Note - in js file use for deafer <script src="script.js" defer></script>
Q - What does it mean to 'debug' a JavaScript program? And why should we learn to debug our code?
Q - What is a 'breakpoint' in JavaScript debugging?

## Dialog Boxes
There are three types of dialog boxes
1- alert("Your Message goes here.")
2- confirm("Your Message goes here.")

* length
### Methods (Without Argument)
* toLowerCase()
* toUpperCase()
* trim() - Remove Extra whitespace
* trimStart()
* trimEnd()

### Methods (With Argument)
* includes() -  searching for specific words
* indexOf()
* replace()
* replaceAll()
* concat() - adding Strings
* padStart()
* padEnd()
* charAt()
* charCodeAt()
* split() - all Characters are brack in array

## Math in JavaScript
 Mathematical Operators

* Addition Operator : +
* Subtraction Operator : -
* Multiplying Operator : *
* Divide Operator : /
* Remainder Operator : %
* Exponentiation Operator : **

### Math Object in JavaScript

#### Properties on Math Object

* Math.PI
* Math.SQRT2
* Math.E

### Methods On Math Object

* Math.sqrt(x)
* Math.Pow(x,y)
* Math.Floor(X)
* Math.ceil(X)
* Math.round(X)
* Math.random()

* 8 /0 = Infinite or -9 / 0  = Infinite

## Truthy and Falsy Values

#### Falsy Values
* O
* NaN
* -0
* ""
* undefined
* null
* false

## Comparison Operators in JavaScript

* == Equal to (equality) [it Does Implicit (automatic) Conversion]
* === Equal value and equal type (strict equality)
* != Not Equal
* !== not equal value or not equal type (strict)
* > Greater then
* < less then
* >= Greater then or equal to
* <= less then or equal to
