## History of JavaScript

### This is Netscape Navigator
 - A web browser which used to dominate the world in 90s with the market share of around 90%.
 - This is where the story of JavaScript starts from.

### Static Websites 
 - Website used to be static then. and browsers could not do even a single calculation at that time.
- In order to do even a simple math browser had to talk to servers.

### Making the Language of Web
- So the Founder of Netscape decided to develope a programming language for his Netscape.

### Making the Language of Web
- In september 1995 Andreessen hires one guy called Brendan Eich to develop that Language.
#### <b>Development of JavaScript </b>
-  Brendan stats the Development and the rest is History. He Developed the whole new Language in just 10 freaking days and that language was called "Mocha". Then it is was changed to "LiveScript" and then finally JavaScript.

## JavaScript Variables

A javascript variable is just a name of storage location,and we can give that name in three ways.
- Using let Keyword
- Using var Keyword
- Using const Keyword

#### Rule of naming Variables

A variable name can contains any of the following characters but must not start with a digits.

- <b>Capital Latters:</b> A to Z
- <b>Small Letters:</b> a to z
- <b>Digits:</b> 0 to 9 (but we can't start variable name with a digit)
- <b>Only two special charaters that are:</b> Dollor "$" and Underscore "_

Note - in js file use for deafer <script src="script.js" defer></script>

## String Methods and Properties
    <p>
      Before starting string methods and properties we need know that strings
      are indexed. So basically we can access any single character of a string
      by doing something like this.
    </p>
    <p>Expression: <code>'Hello World'[1]</code></p>
    <p>Result: <code>'e'</code></p>
    <p>There is only one property that exists.</p>
    <h2>Property</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><code>length</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Methods (Without Argument)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><code>toUpperCase()</code></li>
      <li><code>toLowerCase()</code></li>
      <li><code>trim()</code></li>
      <li><code>trimStart()</code></li>
      <li><code>trimEnd()</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Methods (With Argument)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><code>includes()</code></li>
      <li><code>indexOf()</code></li>
      <li><code>replace()</code></li>
      <li><code>replaceAll()</code></li>
      <li><code>concat()</code></li>
      <li><code>padStart()</code></li>
      <li><code>padEnd()</code></li>
      <li><code>charAt()</code></li>
      <li><code>charCodeAt()</code></li>
      <li><code>split()</code></li>
    </ul>
